**Project Title: To-Do List Manager**

**Description:**
The goal of this project is to create a simple to-do list manager where users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view their list of tasks. Each user has their own to-do list, and each to-do list is represented as a single linked list of tasks. The users are stored in an array. The project will demonstrate the use of arrays and single linked lists in Java.

**Expectations and Functionalities:**
1. User Management
   - Ability to add a user and store them in an array
   - Each user has a unique name
2. Task Management
    - Ability to add a task to a user's to-do list
    - Each task has a description and status (completed or pending)
    - Tasks are stored in a single linked list
3. Mark Task as Completed
    - Ability to mark a task as completed by updating its completion status
4. View Tasks
    - Ability to view all tasks for a user along with their completion status

**Implementation Details:**
1. Task Class
    - Stores the description and completion status of a task
    - Includes a method to mark a task as completed
2. User Class
    - Stores the name of the user and their to-do list ( a single linked list of tasks)
    - Includes methods to add a task to the to-do list, mark a task as completed, and print all tasks
2. Main Class
    - Creates Users and adds them to an array
    - Adds tasks to a user's to-do list
    - Marks tasks as completed
    - Prints all tasks for a user
